The application is named “Find Nursery” and concerns the creation of a database containing 
information about Nurseries throughout the country, which is accessible to both Nursery 
owners, with the ability to create a business profile, as well as parents searching for the most 
suitable Nursery for their children. The application provides the ability to view Nurseries 
profiles and photos, find them in location maps, contact them via email or phone through 
the application, but also offers the ability to use filters in order to search the database with 
criteria, according to user requirements.
